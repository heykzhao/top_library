# Library

This is a basic library application, which allows a user to keep track of a 
list of books. For each book, a user can input the book's title, book's 
author, and indicate whether or not they've read it. If a book has been read,
they can also give the book a rating using the stars below each card. 

This application utilizes the WebStorageAPI to also keep track of user inputs,
so that when the page refreshes, the additions and edits are maintained.
